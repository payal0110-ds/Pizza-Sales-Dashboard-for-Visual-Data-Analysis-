The use of good visualizations can help people interpret complex data sets clearly and concisely. A data visualization tool helps us identify patterns, trends, and relationships from raw data through different types of charts, graphs, and other visual aids. This helps in decision-making and enables us to extract valuable insights from the data and communicate them effectively. ‘Tableau’ eases this process by having many interactive options and customization options. As Tableau can handle a large amount of data, it is a powerful and fastest growing data visualization tool used in the Business Intelligence Industry.

Visual analysis transforms raw data into visually compelling formats, making it easier to understand, communicate, and act upon. Its ability to enhance comprehension, facilitate exploration, and support decision-making makes it an invaluable asset across various industries and disciplines.
